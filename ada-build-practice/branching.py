# Ada Build 
# Intro to Python 
# Lesson 03 Assignment 

# ** LEARNING GOALS **
# Understand and use relational operators.
# Understand and be able to use conditional statements.
# Understand the control flow of a program.
# Identify and debug simple logic errors.


# Conditionals Syntax
# Practice 1
temp = 40

if temp < 50:
    print("It's a bit chilly outside")
# It's a bit chilly outside

# Practice #2
temp = 100

if temp < 50:
    print("It's a bit chilly outside")
else:
    print("It's pleasant outside")
    # It's pleasant outside

# Practice #3
temp = 0

if temp == 100:
    print("It's ONE HUNDRED DEGREES outside!")
elif temp < 100:
    print("It's warm outside")
elif temp < 50:
    print("It's a bit chilly outside")  
elif temp == 0:
    print("It's ZERO DEGREES outside!") 
# It's warm outside
# this is a logic error

if temp == 0:
    print("It's ZERO DEGREES outside!") 
elif temp == 100:
    print("It's ONE HUNDRED DEGREES outside!")
elif temp < 50:
    print("It's a bit chilly outside") 
elif temp < 100:
    print("It's warm outside")
# It's ZERO DEGREES outside!

# Black Jack Debugging Exercise
# Fix the logic error:
score = 21

if score < 17:
    print("Hit Me!")
elif score < 21:
    print("Great Hand")
elif score >= 21:
    print("Bust!")
else:
    print("Black Jack!")

# Change to: 
if score == 21:
    print("Black Jack!")
elif score < 17:
    print("Hit Me!")
elif score < 21:
    print("Great Hand!")
else:
    print("Bust!")

# Divisible by 5
x = 2023

if x % 5 == 0:
    print(f"{x} is divisible by 5")
else:
    print(f"{x} is not divisible by 5")
# 2023 is not divisible by 5


# Conditionals Syntax
# Practice 1
x = 20 / 5
y = 6 * 2

if x == y:
  print('equal')
elif x < y:
  print('loss')
else:
  print('greater')

# Practice 2
if number_of_sides == 1:

    print("I'm not really sure what you have")
elif number_of_sides == 3:
    print "You've got a triangle"
elif number_of_sides == 4:
    print("You've got some sort of quadrilateral")

# Is there more than one line?
# No -- you have a line.
# Yes -- Continue.
# Is there more than 2 lines?
# No -- I'm not sure what you have.
# Yes -- Continue.
# Is there more than 3 lines?
# No -- you have a triangle.
# Yes -- Continue.
# Is there more than 4 lines?
# No -- you've got some sort of quadrilateral.
